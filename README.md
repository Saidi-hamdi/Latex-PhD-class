# Latex-PhD-class
This is a repository containing a latex class I used for my phd thesis at _Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris_.
It contains a structure using makefile and latexmk, so only the modified parts will be compiled each time. There are several modes both for compiling (accessible as options for the make command) and for latex class (accessible by specifing the options in the `\documentclass` command.

In the following we are going to expand the information above and to explain the use of various class options in detail.
## How to Use
### Requirements

A full TeX distribution is assumed.  [Various distributions for different operating systems (Windows, Mac, \*nix) are available](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/55437) but TeX Live is recommended.
You can [install TeX from upstream](http://tex.stackexchange.com/q/1092) (recommended; most up-to-date) or use `sudo apt-get install texlive-full` if you really want that.  (It's generally a few years behind.)

### Basic Usage

At a command prompt, run
```bash
$ make TARGET = path_to_file/{your-file}.tex
```
This should result in the creation of ``{your-file}.pdf`` and a locked copy ``locked.{your-file}.pdf``

## Compilation with makefile

The makefile contains the instruction to compile the whole thesis or a single chapter. It makes use of the latexmk command (you can install it, in an Ubuntu/Debian environment with the command
```bash
sudo apt-get install latexmk
```
### Make Options

Indeed, the several make options are:

* all
* view
* continuos
* clear
* clearall
* force
* rebuild


Command               | Description
-------------         | -------------
`make all` or `make`  | Compiles the default TARGET tex file.
`make view`           | Compiles and shows the produced pdf file.
`make continuous`     | Compiles live and updates the produced pdf file.
`make clear`          | Compiles and removes the auxiliary files.
`make clearall`       | Compiles and removes auxiliary files and all images and not-locked pdf.

### Compile command

In a terminal one can give the following command
```bash
make
```

### Configuration file

The hidden file `.latexmkrc` contains the configurations for the working of make command.

#### Ubuntu/Debian vs OSX use.

As it is, the whole structure works on Linux systems with evince installed.
If you wanna change the pdf viewer, you have to change the line
```perl
$pdf_previewer = 'start evince %O locked.%S';
```
to

```perl
$pdf_previewer = 'start your_pdf_viewer %O locked.%S';
```

To work in Mac OSX, you can simply write

```perl
$pdf_previewer = 'start open %O locked.%S';
```
## LaTeX use and class options

The class comes with three options:

* debug
* draft
* externalize

The `debug` and `draft` modes are quite similar.
They both print on the pdf margins, comments and labels.

The only difference is that the `debug` mode does not print out the TikZ images.

The `externalize` mode exports the TikZ images in the `./Resources/Externalised` folder.

Leaving the option field empty you get a mode as in the final version of the document, without any comment printed out.
Since the class is `standalone`, one does not have to worry about changing anything in single chapters, since the option of the main document will be taken.

Thus the advice is to always compile chapters in debug or draft mode - including comments, warnings and notes - and then compiling the main at the end with no option.

### Comments
A different section because there are three types of comments.

Comments will appear as side-notes.

The first type of comment is a tru comment, it appears in gray and corresponds to the default behaviour of the command
```LaTeX
\comment{This is a comment.}
```
or one can indicate it with the option label `c`.
```LaTeX
\comment[c]{This is a comment.}
```
Another option is `e`, this indicates an error and appears in red.
```LaTeX
\comment[e]{This is an error.}
```
Finally there are warnings,
```LaTeX
\comment[w]{This is a warning.}
```

They all have independent numbering sequences and they are only visible in debug or draft modes.

### LaTeX
LaTeX is a fantastic typesetting program that a lot of people use these days, especially the math and computer science people in academia.
