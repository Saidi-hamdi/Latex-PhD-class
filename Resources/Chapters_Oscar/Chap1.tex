	\chapter{Differential Geometry Preliminaries}
	\label{chap1}

		In this chapter we introduce the mathematical notions required for this thesis. 
		In particular, we collect some definitions about $G$-structures, holonomy and torsion, in order to extend them to the generalised analogous in the next chapter.
		These concepts are the mathematical way to encode the topological and differential conditions on the internal manifold coming from supersymmetry in string compactifications. 
		
		We will see in the following how to precisely relate the existence and the integrability of $G$-structures to the supersymmetry of the compactified theory.
		
		\section{Introduction and Motivations}
			%
				We are mainly interested in compactifications and dimensional reductions preserving a certain fraction of the original supersymmetry.
				
				The first consequence of this requirement is the fact that the manifolds we consider to be internal spaces must support spinors, namely they must be \emph{spin manifolds}.
				
				We will determine the number of supersymmetries the lower dimensional theory will have by giving the decomposition ansatz for the spinorial higher dimensional supersymmetry parameters.
				In order to perform this decomposition, we take the ansatz for spacetime solutions to be in the form
					%
						\begin{equation}\label{spacetimeans}
							M_{D} = X \times M_{d}\, ,
						\end{equation}
					%
				where $X$ is a Lorentzian (\emph{external}) spacetime and $M_{d}$ is a Riemannian manifold, often called \emph{internal} space.
				The supersymmetry parameters are generically indicated by $\epsilon$, transforming in the fundamental representation of $\mathrm{Spin}(D-1,1)$, and they have to decompose, according to the~\eqref{spacetimeans}, as,
					%
						\begin{equation*}
							\epsilon = \sum_{k=1}^\mathcal{N} \varepsilon^k \otimes \eta^k\, .
						\end{equation*}
					%
				The $\varepsilon^k$ are the lower dimensional supersymmetry parameters, \emph{i.e.} $\mathrm{Spin}(D-d-1,1)$ spinors, while $\eta^k$ are commuting $\mathrm{Spin}(d)$ spinors.
				The number $\mathcal{N}$ of linearly independent spinors satisfying the relation above is the number of supersymmetries of the lower dimensional theory.
				Note that this relation must hold over the whole space, thus the $\eta^k$ must be well-defined at every point of the internal space.
				Indeed, so far there are no differential conditions imposed on these spinors, the only condition we require on the internal spinors is then topological: to be globally defined.
				This requirement ensures that the truncation ansatz is everywhere well-defined, furthermore, as we will see in the next section, this is a non-trivial topological condition. 
				It imposes the reduction of the structure group of the internal manifold and it allows us to make use of the formalism of $G$-structure -- whose description is the major aim of the next sections -- to study systematically dimensional reductions and flux compactifications in string theory.
				%

		\section{\texorpdfstring{$G$-structures}{G-structures}}
			\label{gstruc}
			%
				In this section consider $G$-structures.
				We take into account a manifold $M$ of real dimension $d$.
				
				\subsection{Structure groups}
				%
					Since on each patch one can introduce a local basis, a generic vector $v$ can be expanded as
						%
							\begin{equation}
								v = v^a_{(\alpha)} e_a^{(\alpha)}\, ,
							\end{equation}
						%
					and its coordinates on the overlap of two patches are related by a local change of coordinates,
						%
							\begin{align}
								& & & & & & v^a_{(\alpha)} = M_{\alpha\beta\phantom{a} b}^{\phantom{\alpha \beta}a}\ v^b_{(\beta)}\, ,& & \mbox{on}\quad U_\alpha \cap U_\beta \, ,& & & &
							\end{align}
						%
					where the transformation $M_{\alpha\beta}$ is a $\GL(d, \RR)$.
					Since the construction depend on the point $p \in M$, the matrices $M_{\alpha\beta}$ can be seen as maps from the manifold to the group $\GL(d, \RR)$,
						%
							\begin{equation*}
								\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=.3mm]
									M_{\alpha \beta} :\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! & M \arrow{r} & \GL(d, \RR) \\
 									& p \arrow[mapsto]{r} & M_{\alpha \beta}(p)
								\end{tikzcd}
							\end{equation*}
						%
					These \emph{transition functions} contain all the information about the non-trivial topology of the tangent bundle.
					The following cocycle condition is required on the triple overlap for consistency,
						%
							\begin{equation}
								M_{\alpha\beta} M_{\beta\gamma} = M_{\alpha\gamma}\, ,
							\end{equation}
						%
					and in addition,
						%
							\begin{equation}
								M_{\alpha\beta}M_{\beta\alpha} = 1\, .
							\end{equation}
						%
					Note that the last two equations are nothing else than the closure and the existence of the identity axioms in a group. So, we can see the set of the transition functions has the structure of a group.
					The group of transition functions\footnote{%
						One can define the transition functions also as the action of the group on the fibre, in order to change local frame.
						This is also mentioned above and it is related to the interpretation of active/passive transformations.%
						} %
					is called the \emph{structure group} of the tangent bundle.
						%
							\begin{figure}[h]
							\centering
								\scalebox{1.5}{\input{./Resources/ImagesTikZ/FrameBundle}}
								\caption{The action of the structure group on the frame bundle is an action on the fibre only, leaving the point $p \in M$ untouched.}
								\label{gactfibre}
							\end{figure}
						%
					An alternative definition of the structure group is the group of the transition functions of the frame bundle $F$ in~\eqref{framebund}.
					Since a vector field $v$ is invariant across patches, we have that the frames transform with the inverse transformation with respect to the vector components,
						%
							\begin{align}
								& & & & & & e_a^{(\alpha)} = M_{\alpha\beta\, a }^{\phantom{\alpha \beta a} b }\ e_b^{(\beta)}\, ,& & \mbox{on}\quad U_\alpha \cap U_\beta \, .& & & &
							\end{align}
						%
					One can notice that given a reference frame, \emph{e.g.} the coordinate one $e_a \equiv \partial_a$, one can obtain a generic local frame via,
						%
							\begin{equation}
								e^{\alpha}_a = e^{\alpha\phantom{a}b}_a \partial_b\, ,
							\end{equation}
						%
					where $e^{\alpha\phantom{a}b}_a$ can be considered as $\GL(d,\RR)$ elements, giving us the right to identify the fibre of the frame bundle with the $\GL(d, \RR)$ group.

							\end{figure}
						%
				\subsection{The Frame bundle}
				%
				We call \emph{Frame bundle} on $M$ the principal bundle whose fibres at any point $p \in M$ are all ordered basis -- \emph{i.e.} the frames -- of the tangent space $T_p M$, 
					%
						\begin{equation}\label{framebund}
							F = \bigsqcup_{p \in M} F_p\, ,
						\end{equation}
					%
				where,
					%
						\begin{equation}
							F_p := \left\{ (p, \{ e_a \}) \mid p \in M \right\}\, .
						\end{equation}
					%
				Generically, one can identify the fibre with $\GL(d,\RR)$.
				The group $\GL(d,\RR)$ acts freely and transitively on each fibre on the right - \emph{i.e.} $F_p$ is a principal homogeneous space for $\GL(d,\RR)$ - to give another frame on the fibre. 
				From this point of view we can see the action of the group $\GL(d,\RR)$ as the way of changing frames keeping the point $p \in M$ fixed, so the change of frame is a transformation on the fibre only, see~\cref{gactfibre}.
				
				The set $\{e^{(\alpha)}_a\}$ defines in general a local frame on the manifold $M$ over the patch $U_{\alpha}$, namely a set of $d$ vector fields spanning $T_p M$. 
				Generally, it might not be possible to define it over the whole manifold, as it might not be possible to cover the manifold with a single chart.
				The particular case where a \emph{global frame} is defined is when the manifold is \emph{parallelisable}. 
				A noteworthy example of parallelisable manifolds are Lie groups. 
				This notion will be important for this work and we will discuss it -- and its generalisation in Generalised Geometry -- in detail in the next chapter.
				
				For simplicity we will present the various definitions using the tangent bundle, however, these and the related properties hold also for more general bundles $E$ on $M$, with a generic vector space $V$ as fibre, with a group $G$ acting on $V$.
			%

			\subsection{\texorpdfstring{$G$-structures}{G-structures}}
				%	
					A manifold $M$	 admits a $G$-structure if it is possible to reduce the structure group of $TM$ to a subgroup $G \subset \GL(d, \RR)$.
					This means that the transition functions take value in a subgroup $G$ of the general linear group.
					In other words, a $G$-structure is a principal sub-bundle of the frame bundle, $P \subset F$.
					
					An alternative definition can be given in terms of globally invariant tensors, in the case the manifold $M$ admits a spin structure, also in terms of invariant spinors.
					We say a manifold $M$ has a $G$-structure if (and only if)\footnote{%
						Consider the inverse implication. 
						Given a non vanishing, globally defined tensor (or spinor), $\xi$, one can take the set of frames under which $\xi$ takes the same form.
						Then, it is possible to see that the structure group of the frame bundle reduces to the subgroup $G$.
						Thus, the existence of $\xi$ implies $M$ has a $G$-structure.%
						}
					there exists a globally defined $G$-invariant tensor or spinor.
					
					The relation between $G$-structure and globally defined invariant tensors holds also for other vector bundles, with structure groups different from $\GL(d,\RR)$. 
					In particular, it extends to spin bundles and spin structure groups.
					In these cases, the globally defined invariant objects are spinors.
					
					As additional comment, one can see the construction as follows. 
					The frames (\emph{i.e.} points on the fibres of the principal bundle) are elements of $\GL(d,\RR)$. 
					Once we reduce the structure group to some $G \subset \GL(d,\RR)$, they are connected by $G$ transformations.
					We can define an equivalence relation on the set of frames such that all the frames $G$-connected are equivalent.
					The coset made by modding out all the equivalent frames is $\GL(d,\RR)/G$ and the invariant tensor defining the $G$-structure is nothing else than a representative of this coset in a suitable representation.
					Concretely, all the possible (independent) choices of the invariant tensors are related to the equivalence classes of this relation. 
					Changing our choice of the invariant tensor on a manifold means to change the equivalence class, not the structure~\cite{liegroupstruc}.
					As typical example, consider a Riemannian metric $g$ on a manifold $M$.
					$g$ is an element of $\GL(d,\RR)/\rmO(d)$, thus all the metric given by an $\rmO(d)$ transformation of $g$ are equivalent.
					
					The known (and loved) structures that we are used to in differential geometry can be reinterpreted as $G$-structures on the manifold $M$, as summarised in~\cref{tabstruct}.
					Here we explore some examples in a bit more detail.

							\end{table}
						%
				%
					%
					\subsubsection{Orientation}
						%
						A globally defined and nowhere vanishing $d$-form on a $d$-dimensional manifold is called \emph{volume form}.
						This is preserved by the group of transformations with unit determinant, \emph{i.e.} the $\SL(d,\RR)$ subgroup of $\GL(d,\RR)$.
						This structure fixes an orientation over the manifold, allowing us to define an integration operator over it.
						%
					%
					\subsubsection{Riemannian structures}
						%
						A manifold is said \emph{Riemannian} when it admits a globally defined, positive-definite, symmetric covariant $2$-tensor, \emph{i.e.} a \emph{metric} $g$.
						In this case, one can choose a set of local frames $\{e_a\}$ on $M$ such that,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									e_a^m e_b^n g_{mn} = \delta_{ab}
								\end{equation}
							%
						and the structure group reduces from $\GL(d,\RR)$ to $\rmO(d)$.
						In the case it is possible to define a globally defined volume form associate to the metric $g$, the manifold is \emph{orientable} and the structure group further reduces to the subgroup of $\rmO(d)$ preserving this orientation,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\SO(d) = \SL(d,\RR) \cap \rmO(d)\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						%
					%
					\subsubsection{Almost complex structures}
						%
						Consider again a manifold of real dimension $d$. 
						An \emph{almost complex structure} is a globally defined tensor,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=tiny]
										I :\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! & TM \arrow{r} & TM \\
 											& v^m \arrow[mapsto]{r} & I^m_{\phantom{m}n} v^n \, ,
									\end{tikzcd}
								\end{equation}
							%
						satisfying,
							%
								\begin{equation}
								\label{I2mid}
									I^m_{\phantom{m}n} I^n_{\phantom{n}k} = - \delta^m_{\phantom{m}k}\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						The condition above implies that $I$ is non-singular\footnote{%
							Note that locally one can always define a tensor with such properties, the crucial point to be an almost complex structure is that it has to be globally defined over the manifold.%
							}.
						
						Another consequence of the relation $I^2 = - \mathrm{id}$ is the fact that the manifold dimension must be even.
						Indeed, taking the determinant of~\eqref{I2mid} we have $(\det I)^2 = (-1)^d$. 
						$I$ is a real tensor, then $\det I$ must be real, so $(-1)^d > 0$, and this implies $d$ is even.
						
						A manifold of real dimension $d=2n$ is called \emph{almost complex} if and only if it admits an almost complex structure on it.
						
						Going back to discuss the structure group, it is easy to show that the structure group $\GL(d, \RR)$ reduces to $\GL(n, \CC)$.
						
						The structure $I$ can be used to split the tangent bundle $TM$ in two subspaces, corresponding to the eigenspaces of the map $I$. 
						They are related to the eigenvalues $\{ i, -i \}$\footnote{%
							A subtlety: in order to allow for eigenvectors related to complex eigenvalues, we have to take into account the complexification of the tangent bundle $TM \otimes \CC$.%
							}
						and are one the complex conjugate of the other, and define a complex basis for the fibres.
						Hence, we can define projector operators,
							%
								\begin{equation}\label{projL}
									P_{\pm} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\id \mp i I \right)\, ,
								\end{equation}
							%
						projecting onto the two eigenspaces.
						Since $I$ is globally defined, so are the projectors. This implies that the tangent bundle splits globally as,
							%
								\begin{equation}\label{tsplit}
									TM \otimes \CC = TM^{(1,0)} \oplus TM^{0,1}	\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						Since $I$ is real, $TM^{(1,0)}$ and $TM^{(0,1)}$ are sub-bundles of equal rank.
						Sub-bundles that are locally spanned by smooth vector fields are called \emph{distributions}.
						
						Note that a $k$-tensor follows the decomposition~\eqref{tsplit} by induction. 
						Thus, a generic $k$-tensor is decomposed into $p$ holomorphic indices and $k-p$ anti-holomorphic ones.
						Since for the complexified cotangent bundle an identical decomposition holds,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									T^*M \otimes \CC = T^*M^{(1,0)} \oplus T^*M^{0,1}\, ,
								\end{equation}
							%
						then, a generic $k$-form is decomposed in holomorphic and anti-holomorphic components.
						%
						Then, one has
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\Lambda^k T^*M = \bigoplus_{i}^k \left( \Lambda^i T^*M^{(1,0)} \otimes \Lambda^{k-i} T^*M^{(0,1)} \right) =: \Lambda^{k,k-i} T^*M\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						We denote as $\Lambda^{p,q} T^*M$ the anti-symmetric bundle of rank $p+q$, whose section are the $(p,q)$-forms.
						We also denote as $\Omega^{p,q}(M)$ the space of sections of $\Lambda^{p,q} T^*M$.
						
						Again, the $G$-structure is $\GL(n, \CC)$, and the tensor $I$, in a basis adapted to holomorphic and anti-holomorphic distributions, has the following fixed form,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									I = \diag( i \id_n , -i \id_n )\, ,
								\end{equation}
							%
						defined modulo $\GL(n, \CC)$ transformations.
		
						The same reduction of the structure group can be seen in terms of the so-called \emph{fundamental} form, an holomorphic $n$-form $\Omega$.
						One can define a local coframe of $n$ independent $(1,0)$-forms $\phi^i \in \Gamma(\Lambda^{1,0} T^*M)$ and use it to define a local section of the bundle $\Lambda^{n,0} T^*M$, which is said \emph{canonical line bundle},
							%
								\begin{equation}\label{Odec}
									\Omega = \phi^1 \wedge \ldots \wedge \phi^n\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						The fundamental form is non-degenerate,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\Omega \wedge \bar{\Omega} \neq 0\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						An important point we want to stress is that $\Omega$ has to be \emph{simple}, that is locally decomposable into $n$ complex one-forms as in~\eqref{Odec}.
						In general, one should notice that an almost complex structure determines the forms $\phi^i$ only up to a $\GL(n,\CC)$ transformation. 
						This means that the fundamental form $\Omega$ can change between patches by an overall complex function (the determinant of the transformation).
						Thus, an almost complex structure does not need a globally defined $(n,0)$-form.
						However, if such a form exists the structure group reduces further to $\SL(n, \CC)$.
						Explicitly, once we have a fundamental form on a manifold, we can extract the almost complex structure from it via the following relation,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									I^m_{\phantom{m}n} = a\ \epsilon^{mm_1 \ldots m_{d-1}} (\mathfrak{R}e\ \Omega)_{n m_1 \ldots m_{d/2 - 1}} (\mathfrak{R}e\ \Omega)_{m_{d/2} \ldots m_d}\, ,
								\end{equation}
							%
						where $\epsilon^{m_1 \ldots m_d}$ is the Levi-Civita symbol in $d$ dimensions and $a$ is chosen such that $I$ is suitably normalised to satisfy the~\eqref{I2mid}.
					%
					\subsubsection{Pre-symplectic structures}
						%
						A manifold $M$ of dimension $d = 2n$\footnote{%
							This hypothesis is not restrictive at all, in fact the existence of a non-degenerate pre-symplectic form requires the dimension to be even as for the complex structure above.%
								}
						is said to have a \emph{pre-symplectic structure} (or almost symplectic) if and only if there exists a globally defined, non-degenerate anty-symmetric real $2$-form $\omega$,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\omega \in \Omega^2 (M, \RR)\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						We can see it as an invertible linear map,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=tiny]
										\omega :\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! & TM \arrow{r} & T^*M \\
 											& v \arrow[mapsto]{r} & \omega(v, \cdot) =: \iota_v \omega \, ,
									\end{tikzcd}
								\end{equation}
							%
						and its non-degeneracy is equivalently re-written as,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\underbrace{\omega \wedge \ldots \wedge \omega}_{n\ \text{times}} \neq 0\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						In particular, an almost symplectic structure defines a volume form,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\mathrm{vol}_d = \frac{1}{n!} \omega^n\, ,
								\end{equation}
							%
						and so an orientation on the manifold.
						
						The existence of such a structure reduces the structure group to $\Sp(d,\RR)$.
						%
					%
					\subsubsection{Almost Hermitian manifolds}\label{almHermstruct}
						%
						A manifold $M$, endowed with a metric $g$ and an almost complex structure $I$, is \emph{almost Hermitian} if and only if the two structures are compatible, \emph{i.e.},
							%
								\begin{equation}\label{hermetr}
									g_{pq} I^{p}_{\phantom{p}m} I^{q}_{\phantom{q}n} = g_{mn}\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						In this case the metric is said \emph{Hermitian}.
						
						On a manifold with two compatible invariant tensors, the structure group is reduced to the intersection of the groups leaving invariant the two compatible structures. 
						This is a general statement about $G$-structures of which we will make a large use in the rest of the thesis.
						Thus, on an almost Hermitian manifold, the structure group reduces to the intersection of $\rmO(d)$ and $\GL(d/2,\CC)$.
						This intersection group is $\U(d/2)$,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\U(d/2) = \rmO(d) \cap \GL(d/2, \CC) = \Sp(d,\RR) \cap \GL(d/2, \CC)\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						The last equality -- also represented in figure~\ref{Uinters} -- can be understood by the fact that given an Hermitian metric and an almost complex structure, one can alway rearrange the two invariant tensor to form a third one that has all the good properties of a pre-symplectic structure,
							%
								\begin{equation}\label{symeco}
									\omega = \frac{1}{2} g_{mp} I^{p}_{\phantom{p}n} \dd x^m \wedge \dd x^n\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
							%
							\begin{figure}
							\centering
								\input{./Resources/ImagesTikZ/Uinters}
								\caption{%
									The intersection of two of the three groups of transformations $\GL(n, \CC)$, $\rmO(2n)$ and $\Sp(2n,\RR)$ is the same as the intersection of all the three. 
									It coincides with the group $\U(n)$ and gives an heuristic explanation of the fact that given two of the three structures, one can always build the third one.}
								\label{Uinters}
							\end{figure}
							%
						The $\omega$ in~\eqref{symeco} is non degenerate by construction (from~\eqref{hermetr}).
						On the other hand, given a pre-symplectic and an almost complex structures satisfying the compatibility condition,
							%
								\begin{equation}\label{hersym}
									\omega_{pq} I^{p}_{\phantom{p}m} I^{q}_{\phantom{q}n} = \omega_{mn}\, ,
								\end{equation}
							%
						it is always possible to define a metric
							%
								\begin{equation}\label{mesyco}
									g_{mn} = - \omega_{mp} I^{p}_{\phantom{p}n}\, ,
								\end{equation}
							%
						which is automatically Hermitian, from the~\eqref{I2mid}.
						Finally, as expected, a pre-symplectic structure and a metric always define an almost complex structure.
						The compatibility is given by the following condition,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\omega^{T} g^{-1} \omega = g\, ,
								\end{equation}
							%
						while, one can explicitly build the almost complex structure via,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									I = - g^{-1} \omega\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						%
					%
					\subsubsection{Identity structure}
						%
						Parallelisable manifolds are particularly relevant for supergravity compactifications.
						We will see how they allow to keep all the supersymmetries in the lower dimensional theory.
						In terms of reduction of the structure group, this structure can be seen as the maximal reduction, since it corresponds to reducing the structure group to the identity element only.
						We define a parallelisable manifold in terms of vector fields and tangent spaces, following~\cite{Nakahara}.
						
						Given a $d$-dimensional manifold $M$, a \emph{parallelisation} -- or \emph{absolute parallelism} --  of $M$ is a set $\{ v_1 ,\ldots, v_d\}$ of $d$ globally defined vector fields such that for all $p \in M$, the set $\{ v_1(p) ,\ldots, v_d(p)\} $ forms a basis for the tangent space in  $p$, $T_p M$.
							
						If $M$ admits such a set, it is said to be \emph{parallelisable}.

						We can express the previous definition also saying that a manifold $M$ is parallelisable if admits a \emph{global frame}, since each basis vector $e_a$ is a globally defined smooth vector field.
						This property of the manifold restricts the topology of the tangent bundle such that $TM$ is a trivial bundle.
						Indeed, a parallelisation induces an isomorphism between tangent spaces in different points of the manifold.
						For example, aligning frames in each point, we can identify tangent spaces in that points. 
						This assigns a connection with zero curvature to the manifold \cite{paar}.
						
						As mentioned, our goal is to equivalently define the concept of parallelisation from the point of view of $G$-structures, in fact, a parallelisation is a $\{e\}$-structure or \emph{identity structure}, where $\{e\}$ is precisely the trivial group, containing only the identity element.
						
						It is a well-known and remarkable result in algebraic topology -- due to Bott and Milnor et al. \cite{bott, Kervaire} -- that the only parallelisable spheres are $S^1,\ S^3,\ S^7$, this is related to the existence of the normed division algebras $\CC,\ \mathbb{H},\ \mathbb{O}$. 
						Another famous result is the non-existence of a parallelisation for a $2$-sphere. 
						This statement descends directly from the so-called \emph{hairy ball theorem}, a particular case of the \emph{Poincaré-Hopf theorem} that is considered very important since it provides a link between topological properties of manifolds and analytical ones \cite{adams, Hairy}.
						In addition to the spheres we indicated above, there other examples of parallelisable manifolds. 
						The simplest one is given by group manifolds. 
						We can easily find a globally defined set of vector fields, forming a basis on $T_gG$ in each point $g \in G$, \emph{i.e.} a parallelisation. 
						These are the \emph{left(right)-invariant vector fields} $e_a$ that are also related by the Lie algebra condition,
							%
							\begin{equation}
							\label{liealg}
								\left[e_a , e_b \right] = f_{ab}^{\phantom{ab}c}e_c\ ,
							\end{equation}
							%
						where $f_{ab}^{\phantom{ab}c}$ are coefficients that do not depend on the point of the manifold where we evaluate the Lie bracket of the fields and hence are called \emph{structure constants}.
%						If such a parallelisation is admitted, it is possible to define a metric with constant coefficients (see for example \cite{Fuchs}) $g = g_{ab}\, e^a \otimes e^b$, where $g_{ab}$ are constants. 
%						This is nothing else than the \emph{Cartan-Killing metric}, and with $e^a$ we indicated the dual frame of $e_a$.
						
						Note that among the parallelisable spheres, only $S^1 \cong \U(1)$ and $S^3 \cong \SU(2)$ are group manifolds, thus we can state immediately that the class of parallelisable manifolds is bigger than the class of Lie groups. 
						In fact, there are some results in differential geometry stating that a \emph{local group manifold} \emph{i.e.} $ \mathcal{M} \cong G/\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is some discrete, freely-acting subgroup of the Lie group $G$, is a parallelisable manifold. 
						A possible parallelisation is given precisely by the left (right) invariant vector fields of $G$ if $\Gamma$ acts on the left (right), moreover for any local group manifold, the parallelisation satisfies the~\eqref{liealg}.
						Technically, this happens because the condition $M = G / \Gamma$ has some consequences on the left (right) invariant vector fields defined over the manifold. 
						In particular, this set of fields, which plays the role of generators of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, must satisfy the commutation relations~\eqref{liealg}, with the structure constants that do not depend on the point on $M$, as seen before.
						
						The parallelisation property (and its generalisation) will be very important to build maximally supersymmetric truncations of $10$- and $11$-dimensional supergravities, so we will analyse it in detail in the next chapters.
						%
				%
					%
					\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{$\SU(n)$ structures}{SU(n) structures}}
						%
						In~\cref{almHermstruct} we already mentioned that an almost complex structure and a compatible pre-symplectic structure reduce the structure group to $\U(d/2)$.
						In the case a globally defined $(n,0)$-form $\Omega$ (with $n = d/2$) exists associated to the almost complex structure, then we can define an orientation over the manifold and the structure group reduces further to $\SU(n)$.
						
						In terms of invariant tensors, an $\SU(n)$ structure is given by a globally defined, non-degenerate, simple $(n,0)$-form $\Omega$, a real non-degenerate two form $\omega$ and by an hermitian positive definite metric $g$.
						The forms $\omega$ and $\Omega$ satisfy the compatibility condition,
							%
								\begin{equation}\label{compatib1}
									\omega \wedge \Omega = 0\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						The fundamental form $\Omega$ is usually normalised such that,
							%
								\begin{equation}\label{compatib2}
									\Omega \wedge \overline{\Omega} = (-1)^{[n/2]}\, \frac{(2i)^{n}}{n!} \omega^n = \mathrm{vol}_{d}\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						The normalisation factors are chosen such that taking $n$ forms $\phi^i$ as a local basis of one-forms -- in which $\Omega$ takes the form~\eqref{Odec} -- the $\omega$ takes the canonical form,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\omega = - \frac{i}{2} \sum_{i} \phi^i \wedge \bar{\phi}^i\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						
						Now let us make a useful hypothesis, the manifold $M$ admits a spin structure. 
						We assume this having in mind to study supersymmetric background, which impose the internal manifold to be spin.
						Having a spin manifold means that the structure group $\SO(d)$ preserving metric and orientation can be lifted to $\mathrm{Spin}(d)$.
						Under these assumptions, we can equivalently define an $\SU(n)$ structure in terms of invariant spinors.
						
						Before to proceed with the discussion about spinors and structures, we need to point out some definitions.
						A spinor is said \emph{pure} if it is annihilated by half of the gamma matrices. Up to dimension $6$ this condition does not play any role, since any Weyl spinor is also pure. 
						However, in dimensions higher than $6$, this condition becomes relevant since it happens that exist spinors which are not pure.
						A concrete example is the case $d=7$, the only odd dimensional situation allowing for invariant spinors.
						The structure group reduces to $G_2$.
						
						A chiral pure spinor $\eta$, invariant under $\SU(n)$, reduces the structure group to $\SU(n)$.
						The inverse implication is also true.
						An $\SU(n)$-structure implies the existence of a globally defined, pure invariant spinor.
						This invariant spinor is related to the invariant forms we have seen above in terms of bilinears,
							%
								\begin{equation}\label{spinorSUn}
									\begin{split}
										\omega &= i \eta^\dagger \gamma_{(2)} \eta\, , \\
										\Omega &= \eta^T C \gamma_{(n)} \eta\, ,
									\end{split}
								\end{equation}
							%
						where we denoted with $\gamma_{(k)}$ the form having as (constant) components the anti-symmetric product of $k$ gamma matrices.

		\section{Holonomy and Torsion}
			%
				So far we discussed how the existence of certain invariant, globally defined objects is equivalent of a reduction of the structure group of the frame bundle.
				This is a topological notion.
				On the other hand, we want to investigate which kind of (differential) condition is possible to impose to these objects.
				This is the goal of the present section.
				In the following of the thesis, applying these notions to truncations, we will see how differential conditions on the $G$-structures arise naturally by demanding a certain amount of supersymmetry of the truncated theory.
				For the time being, we want just to describe these conditions and to apply them to the examples of structures of the previous section.
				
				We have seen, for instance in the case of an almost complex structure, that the (complexified) tangent bundle is split in sub-bundles corresponding to the eigenspaces of the structure.
				These sub-bundles are locally spanned by smooth vector fields, and then they are what in mathematics is called \emph{distributions}.
				The integrability of the structures is related to the existence of a set of coordinates over the manifold in which the structure has a particularly simple form.
				In the case when it is possible to associate structures to a distribution, their integrability is related to the integrability of the corresponding distribution.
				For this reason we give the definition of the integrability for distributions first.
					%
			%
			\subsection{Integrability of structures}
				%
					We start by the discussing of the integrability of a distribution, then we make use of the \emph{Frobenius theorem} to relate the integrability to the involutivity and to have differential conditions on the tensors associated to the structure.
			
					Let $M$ be a $d$-dimensional manifold.
					A distribution $\Delta$ of dimension $k$ is a vector $k$-subbundle of the tangent bundle $TM$.
					A local basis of $\Delta$ is a set of $k$ vector fields $v_1, \ldots v_k$ locally spanning $\Delta$.
					
					A $k$-dimensional distribution is said to be \emph{integral} if and only if at every point $p \in M$ there exists a sub-manifold $N$ on $M$ such that its tangent space in the point coincide with the distribution,
						%
							\begin{equation*}
								T_p N = \Delta\vert_p \, , \qquad \forall p \in M \, .
							\end{equation*}
						%
					Formally, one can say this induces a \emph{foliation} over the manifold, such that the manifold $M$ has copies of $N$ (the leaves of the foliation) at any point $p$~\cite{LawsFoli}.
					
					The most trivial example of a foliation is the flat space $\RR^n$. It can be decomposed as $\RR^k \times \RR^{n-k}$, with the leaves $\RR^k$ being enumerated by $\RR^{n-p}$.
					Concretely, with $n=3$ and $k=2$, we have $2$-dimensional leaves, being enumerated by a real number (as in a book)~\cref{foliation}.
						%
							\begin{figure}[h!]
							\centering
								\scalebox{1.2}{\input{./Resources/ImagesTikZ/Foliation}}
								\caption{A trivial example of foliation. the leaves are copies of the $\RR^2$ plans and are enumerated by the $z$-coordinate.}
								\label{foliation}
							\end{figure}
						%
					
					A way to rephrase the definition above is the following.
					If a distribution is integrable, at any point $p \in M$ there exists a neighbourhood $U_p$ on which one can define a local set of coordinates $(x^a, y^\alpha)$ with $a=1,\ldots, k$ and $\alpha = 1, \ldots, d-k$, such that the vectors spanning the distribution takes the form,
						%
							\begin{equation}
								v_a = \partial_{x^a}\, ,
							\end{equation}
						%
					The leaves of the foliation are described by the equations
						%
							\begin{equation}
								y^\alpha = 0 \, .
							\end{equation}
						%
					To get an intuition, one can look again at~\cref{foliation}.
					
					For simplicity we will focus on real distributions, however, the discussion can be extended easily to the complex case~\cite{LawsFoli}.
					In this case, we can express the integrability of a distribution through the Lie bracket,
						%
							\begin{equation}
								\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=.3mm]
										[\cdot, \cdot] :\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\! & \Gamma(TM) \times \Gamma(TM) \arrow{r} & \Gamma(TM) \\
 									& v, w \arrow[mapsto]{r} & \left[ v, w \right]
								\end{tikzcd}
							\end{equation}
						%
					At first, we define the \emph{involutivity} of a distribution with respect to this bracket.
					A distribution $\Delta$ is said \emph{involutive} if and only if for any two vector fields $v,w \in \Gamma(\Delta)$, their Lie bracket still belongs to $\Gamma(\Delta)$,
						%
							\begin{equation}
								\left[v, w \right] \in \Gamma(\Delta) \, ,  \qquad \forall v, w \in \Gamma(\Delta) \, .  
							\end{equation}
						%
					An important result in differential topology is \emph{Frobenius theorem}~\cite{LawsFoli}. 
					It states that a distribution is \emph{integrable} if and only if it is \emph{involutive}.
					Because of the equivalence stated by the Frobenius theorem, often involutivity and integrability are concepts which are identified also in definitions.
					
					As stated, Frobenius theorem gives the conditions for a $k$-distribution to be integrable in terms of the vector fields spanning it.
					An alternative picture is the one making use of $d-k$ one-forms annihilated by all the vectors $v_a$,
						%
							\begin{equation}
								\iota_{v_a} \phi^\alpha = 0\, .
							\end{equation}
						%
					We can show the integrability conditions can be expressed in terms of differential conditions on the forms $\phi^\alpha$.
					In order to do so, it might be useful to recall the following identities for the Lie derivative on a generic $p$-form, $\mathcal{L}_v : \Omega^p(M) \rightarrow \Omega^p (M)$,
						%
							\begin{equation}
								\mathcal{L}_v = \left\{\iota_v, \dd \right\} = \iota_v \dd + \dd \iota_v \, ,
							\end{equation}
						%
					and for the latter one can derive the so-called \emph{Cartan identity},
						%
							\begin{equation}
								\iota_{[v, w]} = \left[\mathcal{L}_v, \iota_w \right] \, .
							\end{equation}
						%
					The identities above are meant as operator equalities, \emph{i.e.} they have to be thought as acting on forms.
					
					Thus using the Cartan identity, one can reformulate the integrability condition in terms of forms,
						%
							\begin{equation}
								\iota_{[v,w]} \phi^\alpha = \iota_w \iota_v \dd \phi^\alpha \, , \qquad \alpha =1, \ldots, d-k \, .
							\end{equation}
						%
					It follows that the distribution $\Delta$ is integrable if and only if
						%
							\begin{equation}\label{int1frm}
								\iota_w \iota_v \dd \phi^\alpha = 0 \, .
							\end{equation}
						%
					Concretely, in the local coordinates $x^a, y^\alpha$, one can choose $\phi^\alpha = \dd y^\alpha$.
					
					It is noteworthy that one can give the $d-k$ conditions~\eqref{int1frm}, in term of just one decomposable $(d-k)$-form $\varphi \propto \phi^1 \wedge \ldots \wedge \phi^{d-k}$,
						%
							\begin{equation}
								\iota_w \iota_v \dd \varphi = 0 \, .
							\end{equation}
						%
					
					A very important point to notice is that not all the structures can be associated to a distribution.
					An example is the pre-symplectic structure.
					However, it still makes sense to wonder about the integrability of such structures in terms of a suitable set of coordinates over the manifold.
						
					An heuristic (but concrete) description of an integrable structure (useful for our purposes) is a structure for which is possible to find a system of adapted coordinates on the manifold, such that the structure takes a particularly simple and fixed form.
					For our concerns, we will rephrase integrability in terms of intrinsic torsion.
					The structure is integrable if its compatible connection is torsion-free.
					We recover the notion of \emph{special holonomy} manifolds as the special case where all the torsions vanish.
					
					We now proceed with examples of integrability for the structures presented in the previous section in order to clarify the concepts.
				%
				\subsubsection{Complex structure}
					%
						Consider an almost complex structure $I$ and the associated distributions $L = TM^{(1,0)}$ and $\overline{L} = TM^{(0,1)}$, corresponding to the eigen-subbundles related to $\pm i$,
							%
								\begin{align*}
									& &	L = \{ v \in TM \otimes C \mid I v = i v \} \, ,	& &	\overline{L} = \{ v \in TM \otimes C \mid I v = -i v \} \, ,.& & 
								\end{align*}
							%
						Since $L$ and $\bar{L}$ are mutually complex conjugate, the integrability of $L$ implies the integrability of $\bar{L}$ and hence of $I$.
						Thus, $I$ is integrable if an only if the $(1,0)$ part (and symmetrically the $(0,1)$ part) of the complexified tangent bundle $TM\otimes \CC$ are closed under Lie bracket, by Frobenius theorem.
						That is, the Lie bracket of two (anti-)holomorphic vector fields must be (anti-)holomorphic.
							%
								\begin{align}\label{FrobCompl}
									& &	P_{\mp} \left[ P_{\pm} v, P_{\pm} w \right] = 0	& &	\forall v,w \in TM \, ,	& &
								\end{align}
							%
						where $P_{\pm}$ are the projectors onto $L$ and $\bar{L}$ respectively, defined in~\eqref{projL}.
						
						We can reformulate the condition above by a map called \emph{Nijenhuis tensor}.
						Given a pair of vector fields $v, w$, let us write the vector field
							%
								\begin{equation}\label{nijten}
									N_I(v,w) := I \left[ I v, w \right] + I \left[ v, I w \right] - \left[ I v, I w \right] + \left[  v, w \right]\, ,
								\end{equation}
							%
						one can prove $N_I$ is actually a tensor, since it depends only on the local value of $v, w$ at each point.
						Thus, $I$ is integrable if and only if
							%
								\begin{align*}
									& & N_I(v,w) = 0 & &  \forall v, w\, .& &
								\end{align*}
							%
						The equivalence is given by observing that both the real and imaginary part of the relation~\eqref{FrobCompl} are proportional to $N_I$.

						In terms of a set of coordinates where $I$ takes a particular form, we state that an almost complex structure $I$, we say it is \emph{integrable} if and only if there exists a set of coordinates where it takes the form,
							%
								\begin{equation}
								\label{diagI}
									I =	\begin{pmatrix}
											i \id	&		0		\\
												0		&	i \id	\\
										\end{pmatrix} \, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						This is equivalent to the two statements above, since given an integrable distribution $L$, one can always find a set of coordinate $z^a, a= 1, \ldots, \mathrm{dim}(L) = d/2$ (called \emph{holomorphic cordinates}) such that the $i$-eigenbundle $L$ is spanned by the vectors,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									v_a = \partial_{z^a} \, ,
								\end{equation}
							%
						under which the structure $I$ takes the form~\eqref{diagI}.
						
						An integrable almost complex structure is called simply \emph{complex structure}, and the manifold $M$ is a \emph{complex manifold}.
%						We can give here two equivalent definitions of integrability for an almost complex structure, maybe more useful from the operational point of view.
%							%
%								\begin{itemize}
%									%
%									\item[-]	The first one refers to the Nijenhuis tensor. 
%											Given a pair of vector fields $v, w$, let us write the vector field
%												%
%													\begin{equation}\label{nijten}
%														N_I(v,w) := I \left[ I v, w \right] + I \left[ v, I w \right] - \left[ I v, I w \right] + \left[  v, w \right]\, ,
%													\end{equation}
%												%
%											one can prove $N_I$ is actually a tensor, since it depends only on the local value of $v, w$ at each point.
%											Thus, $I$ is integrable if and only if
%												%
%													\begin{align*}
%														& & N_I(v,w) = 0 & &  \forall v, w\, .& &
%													\end{align*}
%												%
%										%
%									\item[-]	The second one refers to the closure of a distribution under the Lie bracket, \emph{i.e.} to its involutivity.
%											In this case, the $(1,0)$ part (and symmetrically the $(0,1)$ part) of the complexified tangent bundle $TM\otimes \CC$ must be closed under Lie bracket.
%%											\footnote{%
%%												Actually, this property of a distribution is called \emph{involutivity}. 
%%												A distribution is integrable if and only if it is involutive. 
%%												This is the content of the \emph{Frobenius theorem}.
%%												Because of the equivalence stated by the Frobenius theorem, often involutivity and integrability are concepts which are identified also in definitions.%
%%													}
%											That is, the Lie bracket of two (anti-)holomorphic vector fields must be (anti-)holomorphic.
%												%
%													\begin{align*}
%														& &	P_{\mp} \left[ P_{\pm} v, P_{\pm} w \right] = 0	& &	\forall v,w \in TM \, .	& &
%													\end{align*}
%												%
%											One can see that both the real and imaginary part of the relation above are proportional to $N_I$.
%									%
%								\end{itemize}
%							%
%						An almost complex manifold admitting a complex structure is said \emph{complex manifold}.
%						In the relative section, for almost complex manifolds we have seen that is possible to define complex coordinates in a single patch.
						For a complex manifold, the transition functions are holomorphic functions of the complex coordinates.
						Precisely, requiring holomorphic transition functions allows us to write the $I$ in the diagonal form~\eqref{diagI}.
					%
				\subsubsection{Symplectic structure}
					%
						The integrability for an almost symplectic structure is equivalent to the existence of a set of coordinates on $M$ such that
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\omega = \dd x_m \wedge \dd y^m\, ,
								\end{equation}
							%
						and such that the transition functions are symplectic with respect to the structure.
						Thanks to an important result in differential geometry, the Darboux theorem, we can translate this into a differential equation for the structure,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\dd \omega = 0\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						In other words, we simply demand the closure of the structure.
						
						With lack of fantasy, an integrable pre-symplectic structure is called \emph{symplectic structure} and a manifold endowed with it a \emph{symplectic manifold}.
						
					\paragraph{K\"ahler manifold} Equipped with the weapons of the definitions above, we want to give one of the equivalent definitions of a K\"ahler manifold.
					Following~\cite{KahlBook}, a \emph{K\"ahler manifold} is a complex manifold $(X, I, g)$ with an Hermitian metric $g$, whose associated symplectic structure $\omega$ is integrable.
					
					In other words, given the metric and the complex structure, the form constructed as in~\eqref{symeco} is closed,
						%
							\begin{equation}
								\dd \omega = 0\, .
							\end{equation}
						%
					When this happens, $\omega$ is called \emph{K\"ahler form}.
					%
				%
			%
			\subsection{Intrinsic torsion}
				%
					To any $G$-structure one can associate the notion of intrinsic torsion.
					This is because, as discussed in~\cref{gstruc} a $G$-structure can be seen as a principal bundle over the manifold $M$, with fibres given by the group $G$.
					On this bundle one can defines a connection, known as \emph{principal connection} and define its torsion.
					Although this, we will not discuss the details of the principal connections (but one can read~\cite{koba, topofibre}), since as argued in~\cite{joyce}, given a $G$-structure on $M$, a principal connection on the corresponding principal bundle always induces a connection $\nabla$ on the tangent bundle $TM$\footnote{%
						More precisely one can say that a general connection $D$ is compatible with a $G$-structure if and only if the corresponding connection on the principal frame bundle $F$, restricetd to the sub-bundle $P_G$ defining the $G$-structure, is still a connection on $P_G$~\cite{koba}.
						}.
					Such a connection is said to be \emph{compatible} with the structure and all the properties of the principal connection are inherited by the induced connection.
					For this reason we deal with connection on $TM$ and we are allowed to talk about torsion of the associated $G$-structure.
					
					We start the discussion about the intrinsic torsion by recalling the notion of structure compatibility of the connection on a manifold.
					
					Let $(M,\Phi)$ be a manifold endowed with a $G$-structure defined by a tensor $\Phi$. A connection\footnote{%
						A connection $\nabla$ on a vector bundle $E$ is a map
							%
								\begin{align*}
									\nabla : \Gamma\left(E\right) \rightarrow \Gamma\left(E \otimes T^*M \right)\, ,
								\end{align*}
							%
						such that $\nabla(f v) = f \nabla(v) + v \otimes \dd f$, where $v$ is a section of $E$ and $f$ is a smooth function on $M$.%
						}	
					$\nabla$ on the tensor bundle is said to be \emph{compatible} if
						%
							\begin{equation}
								\nabla \Phi = 0 \, .
							\end{equation}
						%
					In general, given a structure the compatible connection is not unique.
					All the compatible connections differ by a tensor called \emph{torsion tensor},
						%
							\begin{equation}\label{torsmap}
								T_{\nabla} (v,w) = \left[\nabla_v w , \nabla_w v \right] - \left[v , w \right]\, ,
							\end{equation}
						%
					where $v$ and $w$ are generic sections of the tangent bundle and $[ \cdot, \cdot]$ the ordinary Lie bracket.
					
					In general given two different connections they will have a different torsion. 
					However, given a $G$-structure it is always possible to identify a part of the torsion which does not depend on the particular choice of the connection, but only on the $G$-structure.
					This part is called \emph{intrinsic torsion}.
					If the intrinsic torsion vanishes, then the associated $G$-structure is \emph{torsion-free}, \emph{i.e.} there exists at least one connection whose torsion tensor vanishes.
					The interesting fact we want to focus on is the identification of the integrability of the structure with its being torsion-free.
					We will explore this through examples in the following.
					
					Since we are interested to the application of these concepts in string theory compactifications, where we always deal with Riemannian manifolds, we are going to define intrinsic torsion in this case.
					For a rigorous definition of these notions for a generic manifold we refer again to~\cite{joyce}.
					%
				%
				\subsubsection{Metric compatible connection}
					%
						In this section we focus on Riemannian manifolds.
						We are in the presence of an $\rmO(d)$-structure.
						Then, in this case we consider a connection $\nabla$ compatible with the metric, 
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\nabla g = 0 \, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						As for the generic case, we have a torsion free connection, if the torsion of the connection vanishes.
						The interesting fact about Riemannian compatible connections is that the torsion free metric compatible connection exists and is unique, the \emph{Levi-Civita connection}.
						This result is the content of the so-called \emph{fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry}.
						This implies that any metric on $M$ defines an $\rmO(d)$-structure which is torsion free.
						For the following, let us further restrict our attention to orientable manifolds, \emph{i.e.} to $\SO(d)$-structures.
						
						Given a generic metric compatible connection, it can be written as,
							%
								\begin{equation}\label{contrs}
									\nabla = \nabla_{LC} + \kappa\, ,
								\end{equation}
							%
						where we denoted with $\nabla_{LC}$ the Levi-Civita connection and with $\kappa$ a tensor called the \emph{contorsion}.
						
						The contorsion $\kappa$ is the difference between a generic torsion full and the torsion free connection, both metric compatible.
						From the compatibility condition, we require,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\kappa_{mnp} = - \kappa_{mpn}\, ,
								\end{equation}
							%
						where indices are lowered/raised by the metric.
						One can easily show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the torsion and contorsion tensors,
							%
								\begin{align*}
									T_{mn}^{\phantom{mn}p} &= \kappa_{[mn]}^{\phantom{[mn]}p}\, , \\
									\kappa_{mnp} &= T_{mnp} + T_{pmn} + T_{npm} \, .
								\end{align*}
							%
						Hence, we will use the terms torsion and contorsion equivalently.
						
						A consequence of the correspondence between torsion and contorsion is that given a torsion $T$, we can build a connection which torsion $T$ and we are guaranteed that such a connection is actually unique.
						
						Let us now take the case where a further reduction of the structure group is possible. 
						That is, a globally-defined, invariant tensor under a group $G \subset \SO(d)$ exists.
						In general a $G$-structure compatible connection will satisfy
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\nabla g = \nabla \Phi = 0\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						In general, there is no reason for the torsion of this connection to be zero.
						Thus, as we have seen above in~\eqref{contrs}, it is legit to write,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\nabla \Phi = \nabla_{LC} \Phi + \kappa_0 \Phi = 0\, ,
								\end{equation}
							%
						where $\kappa_0$ is called \emph{intrinsic contorsion}\footnote{%
							Heuristically speaking, the intrinsic (con)torsion is the measure of the failure of the structure to be convariantly constant with respect the Levi-Civita connection.
							}.
						It is the bit of the contorsion acting non-trivially on the structure tensor.
						
						To be more explicit, let us consider the symmetry properties of the contorsion.
						$\kappa$ is an element of $T^*M \otimes \Lambda^2 T^*M$.
						Observe that the algebra of $\SO(d)$ -- here denoted as $\mathfrak{so}(d)$ -- is isomorphic to the (linear) space of two forms $\Lambda^2 T^*M$.
						Hence, the contorsion can be interpreted as a one form taking values on the $\mathfrak{so}(d)$ algebra,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\kappa \in T^*M \otimes \mathfrak{so}(d)\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						Let us denote by $\mathfrak{g}$ the sub algebra of $\mathfrak{so}(d)$ corresponding to the algebra of the group $G \subset \SO(d)$.
						We can split the map $\kappa$ in a piece taking values in $\mathfrak{g}$ and another part taking values in $\mathfrak{g}^{\perp}$, the orthogonal complement of $\mathfrak{g}$.
						Explicitly,
							%
								\begin{align}\label{decomk}
								&&	\kappa = \kappa_0 + \kappa_\mathfrak{g}\, , & & 	\begin{array}{l}
																				\kappa_0 			\in T^*M \otimes \mathfrak{g}^\perp \\[1mm]
																				\kappa_\mathfrak{g} \in T^*M \otimes \mathfrak{g}
																			\end{array}	&&
								\end{align}
							%
						Since $\Phi$ is $G$-invariant, the action of $G$ generators is trivial on it, \emph{i.e.} $g \cdot \Phi = 0$, $\forall g \in \mathfrak{g}$.
						So,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\nabla \Phi = (\nabla_{LC} + \kappa_0 + \kappa_{\mathfrak{g}}) \Phi =  (\nabla_{LC} + \kappa_0) \Phi  = 0\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						Thus, the difference between two $G$-compatible connections only lies in the $\kappa_{\mathfrak{g}}$ part of the contorsion.
						All the $G$-compatible connections share the same intrinsic contorsion $\kappa_0$, which is a property of the $G$-structure itself and not of the particular choice of the connection.
						
						The \emph{intrinsic torsion} is defined from the intrinsic contorsion and using the one-to-one relation between torsion and contorsion,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									T^{0\phantom{mn}p}_{mn} = \kappa_{0[mn]}^{\phantom{0[mn]}p} \, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						The intrinsic torsion will result a very important tool, since it provides a classification of $G$-structures.
						The idea is that it is possible to decompose $\kappa_0$ into irreducible representations of the group $G$.
						Then a $G$-structure will be specified in terms of the representations of this decomposition.
						When $\kappa_0$ vanishes, such that $\nabla_{LC}\Phi = 0$, the structure is torsion-free.
					%
				%
					%
				\subsubsection{Complex structure}
					%
						An almost complex structure reduces the structure group to $\GL(n, \CC)$.
						A compatible connection $\nabla$, as we have seen, is such that $\nabla I = 0$.
						In this case, we can show the equivalence of the integrability of the structure to the vanishing of the intrinsic torsion of the $\GL(n, \CC)$-structure.
  						To see this, one can use $\nabla I = 0$ and the definition of torsion map~\eqref{torsmap} to show that, for any $v,w$, the Nijenhuis tensor~\eqref{nijten} can be written as
							%
								\begin{equation}
									N_{I} (v, w) = T_{\nabla} (v,w) - T_{\nabla} (Iv, Iw) + I T_{\nabla} (Iv,w) + I T_{\nabla} (v, Iw) \, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						Thus, being the Nijenhuis tensor proportional to the torsion tensor, if the latter vanishes so does the former, and the almost complex structure is integrable.
  						Since the equation above does not depend on the choice of a particular connection, the obstruction to the integrability of the almost complex structure only comes from the intrinsic torsion.
					%
				%
					%
				\subsubsection{Symplectic structure}
					%
						As already discussed, the pre-symplectic structure corresponds to a reduction of the structure group to $\Sp(d,\RR)$.
						The main point of this brief section is the fact we can find a torsion free compatible connection if and only if $\omega$ is integrable.
						To have an insight of this, let us take into account a compatible connection $\nabla$, such that $\nabla \omega = 0$.
						Then, one can show,
							%
								\begin{equation}
									\dd \omega (u, v, w) = \omega(T_\nabla (u,v), w) + \omega(T_\nabla (w,u), v) + \omega(T_\nabla (v,w), u)\, .
								\end{equation}
							%
						Hence the vanishing of the torsion tensor implies the closure (and so the integrability) of the structure.
						Also in this case, one can prove that the result does not depend on the particular choice of the connection, but on the intrinsic torsion of the $\Sp(d, \RR)$-structure only.
					%

			%
			\subsection{Special Holonomy}
				%
					We want now to analyse another differential property of a manifold: the \emph{holonomy} of a connection.
					This concept will be deeply related to supersymmetry in string compactifications.
					
					We start the discussion by recalling its definition and its relation to $G$-structures.
					
					Let us take into account a manifold $M$ and a differentiable\footnote{%
						In the rest of this thesis, unless specifically indicated, we will not distinguish between continuity and differentiability. In other words, a $\mathcal{C}^0$ function will always be also $\mathcal{C}^\infty$ and an homeomorphism will always be also a diffeomorphism.%
						}
					curve $\gamma$ on it, \emph{i.e.} $\gamma : I \rightarrow M$, where $I$ is a real open interval.
					Then, let $E$ be a vector bundle over its base manifold $M$ and $\nabla$ a connection on $E$. 
					As mentioned at the beginning of this section, the connection $\nabla$ provides a way of moving elements of the fibres along a curve. 
					In particular, it defines an isomorphisms between the fibres at different points along the curve, the so-called \emph{parallel transport} map,
						%
							\begin{align}
								& & & & P_\gamma : E_{\gamma(s)} \rightarrow E_{\gamma(t)} & & \forall t,s \in I\, .
							\end{align}
						%
					
					Let us now consider a \emph{loop}, \emph{i.e.} a closed curve, based at a point $x \in M$, then the parallel transport is an automorphism of the vector bundle at the point $x$,
						%
							\begin{equation}
								P_\gamma : E_{x} \rightarrow E_{x}\, .
							\end{equation}
						%
					As said, the map $P_\gamma$ is an automorphism, so both linear and invertible.
					It is an element of $\GL(E_x) \cong \GL(k, \RR)$, where $k$ is the dimension of the fibres.
					The set of all the possible parallel transports, for the all possible loops based at $x$ defines the \emph{holonomy group} of the connection $\nabla$ based at $x$,
						%
							\begin{equation*}
								\mathrm{Hol}_x (\nabla) := \left\{ P_\gamma \mid \gamma \text{ based at } x \right\}\, .
							\end{equation*}
						%
					In the case of a simply connected manifold $M$, the holonomy group depends on the base point only up to conjugation by an element of $\GL(k,\RR)$.
					More explicitly, if $\psi$ is a path connecting $x$ to $y$ in $M$, then
						%
							\begin{equation*}
								\mathrm{Hol}_x (\nabla) =  P_\psi^{\vphantom{-1}}\ \mathrm{Hol}_y (\nabla)\ P_\psi^{-1}\, .
							\end{equation*}
						%
					Hence, given this relation one often (and we will follow this use) drops the reference to the base point, understanding that the definition holds up to group element conjugation.
					
					An important fact about holonomy for our concerns is that given a a connection on a vector bundle, there is a relation between the action of the holonomy algebra $\mathfrak{hol}(\nabla)$ and the curvature of the connection, for detail on can read~\cite{holon2}.
					Recall that the curvature of a connection $\nabla$ is a two-form $R$ taking values in the Lie algebra\footnote{%
						One can write a connection as the differential operator,
							%
								\begin{equation*}
									\nabla = \dd + A \, ,
								\end{equation*}
							%
						where A is a one-form with values in the Lie algebra of the structure group of M, also called (often misleading) \emph{connection}.
						On a coordinate basis, the connection has the familiar form in physics literature: $\nabla = \dd x^m \otimes \nabla_m$, where and $\nabla_m$ is usually known as covariant derivative.
						
						The \emph{curvature} of the connection is defined as the two-form
							%
							\begin{equation*}
								R := \dd A + \frac{1}{2} \left[A , A\right]\, .
							\end{equation*}
						}
					of the structure group.
					
					Consider now a tensor bundle over a manifold $M$ and suppose that this admits a covariantly constant tensor,
						%
							\begin{equation*}
								\nabla \Phi = 0\, .
							\end{equation*}
						%
					Then this tensor is invariant under parallel transport, and so also under the holonomy group.
					As a consequence the holonomy group cannot be the full $\GL(d, \RR)$, but it must be a subgroup, precisely the one leaving $\Phi$ invariant.
					The opposite statement holds as well, every time we have a reduced holonomy group, there exists an invariant object.
					In this case we say the manifold has a \emph{reduced holonomy}.
					
					Let us consider a connection with reduced holonomy. 
					We know we can always write it as $\nabla = \nabla_{LC} + \kappa_0$.
					This implies one can always find a $G$-structure such that the holonomy group corresponds to $G$, \emph{i.e.} $\mathrm{Hol}(\nabla) = G$.
					If the connection is Levi-Civita, then the corresponding $G$-structure is torsion-free.

			\section{Examples: Calabi-Yau and Sasaki-Einstein}
			\label{CYSE}
				%
				Here we want to expose two very important examples of manifolds with reduced holonomy: \emph{Calabi-Yau} and \emph{Sasaki-Einstein} manifolds.
				The former is relevant for even-dimensional manifolds, while the latter is for odd-dimensional cases.
				The aim of this section is not to be complete, but to give the needed concepts for what follows in the thesis.
				A more complete source of informations (and of references) is~\cite{CalabiYauReview} for Calabi-Yau manifolds, and~\cite{SparksSE} for Sasaki-Einstein ones.
				
				We already restricted our attention to spin manifolds, since we are interested in supergravity compactifications.
				Here we want to justify this choice, saying that this is not too restrictive, since following~\cite[prop. 3.6.2]{joyce}, given a $d$-dimensional manifold $M$, with $d \geq 3$, admitting  $G$-structure with $G$ simply-connected subgroup of $\SO(d)$, then $M$ is spin.
				
				For the sake of concreteness, let us restrict to the case of a six-dimensional manifold. 
				These manifolds are of particular interest since they appear in compactifications of ten-dimensional type II string theory down to four dimensions.
				The structure group $\GL(6)$ is reduced to $\SO(6) \simeq \SU(4)$ by the presence of a metric and an orientation defined by the latter.
				The irreducible spinor representation is the $\mathbf{4}$, thus a globally defined spinor reduces further the structure group.
				To show this, we can say that given a  nowhere zero spinor $\eta$ we can always go to a frame where it takes the form $\left(0,0,0,s\right)$. 
				The $\SU(4)$ transformations leaving this invariant are precisely $\SU(3)$.
				On the other hand, looking at $\SU(4)$ decomposition under $\SU(3)$, one can see that in the fundamental $\mathbf{4}$ there is a singlet, \emph{i.e.} an invariant object under $\SU(3)$.
					%
						\begin{equation*}
							\begin{array}{rccr}
								\SU(4) 			&	\rightarrow	&	\SU(3)					&					\\
								\mathbf{4}			&	\rightarrow	&	\mathbf{3} + \mathbf{1}		&	\eta_+			\\
								\mathbf{\bar{4}}		&	\rightarrow	&	\mathbf{\bar{3}} + \mathbf{1}	&	\eta_+^*					
							\end{array}
						\end{equation*}
					%
				where $\eta_+$ is an $\SU(3)$ invariant spinor, and we have chosen our $6$-dimensional gamma matrices such that $\eta_+^*$ has opposite chirality.
				
				Hence, consider in the following the case of an $\SU(3)$-structure.
				We know from the section on $\SU(n)$-structures above that this is given by globally defined, nowhere-vanishing and invariant $2$-form and $3$-form satisfying compatibility conditions~\eqref{compatib1} and~\eqref{compatib2}, that is
					%
						\begin{align*}
							\omega \wedge \Omega &= 0\, , \\
							\Omega \wedge \bar{\Omega} &= (-1)^{[n/2]} \frac{(2i)^n}{n!} \omega^n\, .
						\end{align*}
					%
				As mentioned, making use of~\eqref{spinorSUn} we can say that this is equivalent to have a nowhere-vanishing, globally defined chiral spinor $\eta_+$.
				
				The structure group $\SU(3)$ is a subgroup of $\SO(6)$.
				Thus, any form on $M$ (from $1$ to $6$) transforms in an irreducible representation of $\SO(6)$.
				The idea is to decompose the all possible forms under $\SU(3)$ and look for the singlets of the structure, these are quantities that can be written in terms of the invariant tensors.
					%
						\begin{equation*}
							\begin{array}{lcrcc}
										&		\SO(6)		&	\rightarrow	&	\SU(3)										&								\\
								\alpha_1	&	\mathbf{6}			&	\rightarrow	&	\mathbf{3} + \mathbf{\bar{3}}						&								\\
								\alpha_2	&	\mathbf{15}		&	\rightarrow	&	\mathbf{8} + \mathbf{3} + \mathbf{\bar{3}} +\mathbf{1}	&	\omega						\\
								\alpha_3	&	\mathbf{10}_c		&	\rightarrow	&	\mathbf{6} + \mathbf{3} + \mathbf{1}					&	\Omega						\\
								\alpha_4	&	\mathbf{15}		&	\rightarrow	&	\mathbf{8} + \mathbf{3} + \mathbf{\bar{3}} +\mathbf{1}	&	\omega \wedge \omega 			\\
								\alpha_5	&	\mathbf{6}			&	\rightarrow	&	\mathbf{3} + \mathbf{\bar{3}}						&	\omega \wedge \Omega = 0		\\
								\alpha_6	&	\mathbf{1}			&	\rightarrow	&	\mathbf{1} 									&	\omega^3 \propto \Omega \wedge \bar{\Omega}
							\end{array}
						\end{equation*}
					%
				
				Let us move on and take into account a connection $\nabla$ compatible with the $\SU(3)$-structure,
					%
						\begin{equation}\label{covdereta}
							\nabla \eta_+ = \nabla_{LC} \eta_+  + \kappa \cdot \eta_+ = 0\, ,
						\end{equation}
					%
				notice that because of~\eqref{spinorSUn} this is equivalent to 
					%
						\begin{align}
							 & &	& & \nabla \omega = 0 \, , & & \nabla \Omega = 0 \, . & & 
						\end{align}
					%
				The contorsion $\kappa$ acts on spinors as,
					%
						\begin{equation}
							(\kappa \cdot \eta_+)_{m}^{\alpha} = \frac{1}{4} \kappa_{mnp} \gamma^{np, \alpha}_{\phantom{np,\alpha}\beta} \eta_{+}^\beta \, .
						\end{equation}
					%
				Again, we can see the (con)torsion as the obstruction to $\eta_+$ or ($\omega$ and $\Omega$) to be covariantly constant with respect to the Levi-Civita connection.
				
				For what discussed in the section about holonomy above, the fact that $\eta_+$ is covariantly constant with respect to the connection $\nabla$ means that $\nabla$ has holonomy $\SU(3)$.
				
				Here, we can repeat the reasoning we have done when we discussed the properties of intrinsic contorsion, specifying it for $d=6$.
				In this particular case, the decomposition~\eqref{decomk} takes the following form,
					%
						\begin{align}
							&&	\kappa = \kappa_0 + \kappa_{\mathfrak{su}(3)}\, , & & 	\begin{array}{l}
																				\kappa_0 			\in T^*M \otimes \mathfrak{su}(3)^\perp \\[1mm]
																				\kappa_{\mathfrak{su}(3)} \in T^*M \otimes \mathfrak{su}(3)
																			\end{array}	&&
						\end{align}
					%
				where we used the fact $\mathfrak{so}(6) \cong \mathfrak{su}(4) \cong \mathfrak{su}(3) \oplus \mathfrak{su}(3)^\perp$.
				We can now apply the contorsion decomposition to the expression for $\nabla \eta_+$, the~\eqref{covdereta}.
				Recall that since $\eta_+$ is an $\SU(3)$ singlet, one has
					%
						\begin{equation}
							\kappa \cdot \eta_+ = 0\, ,
						\end{equation}
					%
				for any $\kappa \in \mathfrak{su}(3)$.
				Hence, one is left with
					%
						\begin{equation}\label{conteta}
							\nabla  \eta_+ = \kappa_0 \cdot \eta_+\, .
						\end{equation}
					%
				Because of the isomorphic map between torsion and contorsion, we can now make use of the torsion tensor for the following discussion.

				The intrinsic torsion $T^0$ can be decomposed into irreducible representations of $\SU(3)$ and use this decomposition to classify the various $SU(3)$ structures.
				We can define an equivalence relation in the set of structures.
				The classes of equivalence are the so-called \emph{torsion classes}~\cite{TorsClass1, TorsClass2}, meaning that all the structures sharing the same intrinsic torsion (or being in the same irrep of $SU(3)$) are equivalent.
					%
						\begin{equation*}
							\begin{array}{rrl}
								T^0 \in T^*M \otimes \mathfrak{su}(3)^{\perp}	& \rightarrow &	\left(\mathbf{3} \oplus \mathbf{\bar{3}}\right) \otimes  \left(\mathbf{1} \oplus \mathbf{3} \oplus \mathbf{\bar{3}}\right)	\\[1.5mm]
																	& \rightarrow &	\underbrace{\left(\mathbf{1} \oplus \mathbf{1} \right)}_{W_1} \oplus \underbrace{\left(\mathbf{8} \oplus \mathbf{8} \right)}_{W_2} \oplus \underbrace{\left(\mathbf{6} \oplus \mathbf{6} \right)}_{W_3} \oplus \underbrace{\left(\mathbf{3} \oplus \mathbf{\bar{3}} \right)}_{W_4} \oplus \underbrace{\left(\mathbf{3} \oplus \mathbf{\bar{3}} \right)^\prime}_{W_5} \, ,
							\end{array}
						\end{equation*}
					%
				The $W_i$ are the representatives of the torsion classes. They can be written as differential forms of different ranks, see~\cref{tabW}.
					%
						\begin{table}[h!]
						\centering
							\begin{tabular}{| c | l |}

							\label{tabW}
						\end{table}
					%
				
				Recall that a form $\alpha$ is said \emph{primitive} if it has a zero contraction with $\omega$, \emph{i.e.} $\omega\lrcorner \alpha = 0$~\cite{joyce}.
				
				Thanks to the torsion classes we can rewrite the~\eqref{conteta} in terms of differential relations on $\omega$ and $\Omega$,
					%
						\begin{subequations}
						\label{diffstruct}
							\begin{align}
								\dd \omega 	&= \frac{3}{2} \IIm \left( \overline{W}_1 \Omega \right) + W_4 \wedge \omega + W_3 \, , \\
								\dd \Omega	&= W_1 \wedge \omega \wedge \omega + W_2 \wedge \omega + \overline{W}_5 \wedge \Omega \, .
							\end{align}
						\end{subequations}
					%
				With these formulae, we can classify the manifolds with $\SU(3)$ structures through the torsion classes.
				We collect some example in~\cref{tabTorsCl},

						\end{table}
					%
				%
				\subsubsection{Calabi-Yau manifolds}
					%
					As one can see in~\cref{tabTorsCl}, we can define a Calabi-Yau three-fold as a six-dimensional compact manifold with a torsionless $\SU(3)$ structure.
					We can give a general definition, in a generic even dimension $d= 2n$~\cite{joyce, joyceLagrang}.
					Recall that a K\"ahler manifold can also be defined as a Riemannian manifold of even dimension $2n$, whose holonomy group is contained in $\U(n)$.
						%
%							\begin{definition}[Calabi-Yau $n$-fold]
%								\label{CYdef}

									Given a compact K\"ahler manifold $M$ of complex dimension $n$, with complex structure $I$, Hermitian K\"ahler metric $g$ and associated K\"ahler form $\omega$, then $(M, I, g, \omega)$ is a \emph{Calabi-Yau $n$-fold} if and only if $g$ has $\SU(n)$ holonomy.
									
%							\end{definition}
						%
					Hence, one can say that Calaby-Yau manifolds are a class of K\"ahler manifold whose holonomy group is contained in $\SU(n)$.
					
					One can also show that this is equivalent to say that a Calai-Yau $n$-fold is a complex manifold, with a compatible (integrable) symplectic structure where in addition the metric associated as in~\eqref{mesyco} is Hermitian and Ricci-flat, \emph{i.e.} $R_g = 0$~\cite{joyce, KahlBook}\footnote{%
						The equivalence of these definitions is actually a consequence of the famous \emph{Calabi conjecture}~\cite{CalabiMetr}, proven by Yau~\cite{YauCalabi}, and so these manifolds were named after them.}.
						
					The standard example of trivial Calabi-Yau manifolds are the even-dimensional tori, equipped with the usual complex structure and metric.
					These are also the only Calabi-Yau compact manifolds for which an explicit Ricci-flat metric is known.
					For all the others, the Calabi theorem guarantees the existence of such a metric, but there is no explicit known construction yet.
					
					To conclude this discussion for Calabi-Yau manifolds, we can rewrite the~\eqref{diffstruct} in this case,
						%
							\begin{align*}
								\dd \omega 	&= 0 \, , \\
								\dd \Omega	&= 0 \, .
							\end{align*}
						%
					This allows us to define a Calabi-Yau manifold in terms of the structures $\omega$ and $\Omega$, saying that a Calabi-Yau structure on an $n$-fold $M$ is the set $(M, \omega, \Omega)$, where $\omega$ and $\Omega$ are respectively an integrable K\"ahler two-form and a complex simple $n$-form defining an integrable complex structure, such that
						%
							\begin{itemize}
							\item [] The structures are compatible, \emph{i.e.} $\omega \wedge \Omega = 0$.
							\item [] The metric defined as in~\eqref{mesyco} is Ricci-flat, \emph{i.e.} $R = 0$.
							\end{itemize}
						%
					%
				%
				\subsubsection{Sasaki-Einstein manifolds}
					%
					These class of manifolds are the odd-dimensional analogous of the Calabi-Yau ones.
					For this reason, they became very important in string compactifications, and as for the Calabi-Yau spaces in $10$-dimensional supergravities, Sasaki-Einstein manifolds provide the internal space for the $11$-dimensional supergravity to $\mathrm{AdS}_4$~\cite{duffKK}. 
					Recently, making use of their geometry has allowed to achieve several interesting results both in flux compactification and in a wider area of research in string theory~\cite{DavideTriSas, DavideSas1, SE1, SE2, SE3, SE4, SE5}.
					
					As the name may suggest a Sasaki-Einstein manifold is a manifold which is both Sasakian and Einstein.
					Then, let us start with thes definition of a Sasakian manifold~\cite{SparksSE}.

					A Riemannian manifold $(S,g)$ is \emph{Sasakian} if and only if its metric cone
										%
											\begin{equation*}
												C(S) := \RR^+ \times S \, ,
											\end{equation*}
										%
					equipped with the metric $\overline{g} = \dd t^2 + t^2 g$, is a K\"ahler manifold.
					
					As first consequence of this definition, we can see that $S$ has to be odd dimensional, \emph{i.e.} $d=2n-1$, where $n$ is the complex dimension of the K\"ahler cone.
					
					An Einstein manifold, on the other hand, is a manifold equipped with an Einstein metric $g$, \emph{i.e.} a metric whose Ricci curvature is proportional to the metric itself,
						%
							\begin{equation*}
								R_g = \lambda g \, , 
							\end{equation*}
						%
					for some real constant $\lambda$.
					For a Sasakian manifold, it turns out that $\lambda = 2(n-1)$. Moreover, one can show that a Sasakian manifold is Einstein if and only if its cone is K\"ahler-Einstein and Ricci flat, namely a Calabi-Yau~\cite{SparksSE}.
					Hence, for a Sasaki-Einstein manifold, the restricted holonomy group\footnote{%
						The restricted holonomy group is the component of the group connected to the indentity element.%
						}
					of its cone is $\mathrm{Hol}^0 (\overline{g}) \subset \SU(n)$.
					
					The standard example in this case is provided by the odd-dimensional spheres $S^{2n-1}$, equipped with the standard Einstein metric.
					In this case the K\"ahler cone is simply the space $\CC^n / {0}$, with the standard Euclidean metric.
					
					A Sasakian manifolds inherits some properties from the K\"ahler structure of its cone.
					One of the most important one for our concerns is the \emph{contact structure}~\cite{contact1}, represented by a nowhere-vanishing vector field $\xi$, known as \emph{Reeb vector field}.
					Using the coordinate $t$ to parametrise the $\RR^+$ direction on the cone, we can write
						%
							\begin{equation}\label{Reeb1}
								\xi = I\left[ t \partial_t \right]\, ,
							\end{equation}
						%
					where $I$ is the complex structure on the cone.
					We will see how this Reeb vector will play an important role in compactifications of type IIB supergravities~\cite{DavideSas1, DavideTriSas} and further in the definitions of generalised structures~\cite{AshmoreESE}.
					
					As we have seen in the last section, on Calabi-Yau manifolds the group structure defines a covariantly constant spinor.
					On a Sasaki-Einstein, we have \emph{Killing spinors}, \emph{i.e.} a spinor $\psi$ such that
						%
							\begin{equation}
								\nabla \psi = \pm \frac{1}{2} \gamma \psi \, ,
							\end{equation}
						%
					namely an eigenstate of the covariant derivative.
					They can be seen as supersymmetry generators.
					 
					A generic Sasaki-Einstein manifold supports two Killing spinors, then, in the case of Freund-Rubin~\cite{FreundRubin} compactification on the $\mathrm{AdS}_4$-solution, we have an $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetry~\cite{duffKK}.
					
					In addition, we can characterise a Sasaki-Einstein manifold equivalently by differential objects with compatibility relations among them.
					Explicitly, a \emph{Sasaki-Einstein structure} on a manifold $M$ is the set $(M, \xi, \sigma, \omega, \Omega)$, where $\xi$ is the Reeb vector of~\eqref{Reeb1}, $\sigma$ the dual one-form defined by $\sigma\left[X \right] = g(\xi, X)$\footnote{%
						Note that the metric $g$ is defined by the two compatible structures $\omega$ and $\Omega$ as in~\eqref{mesyco}. More precisely, the complex and symplectic structure on the K\"ahler cone define a metric $\overline{g}$, whose restriction gives $g$.%
						},
					$\omega$ is a real two-form and $\Omega$ a complex simple $n$-form.
					They have to satisfy the following relations,
						%
							\begin{equation}
								\begin{array}{c c c}
									\omega \wedge \Omega = 0 \, ,	&	\phantom{\dd}	&\iota_\xi \omega = \iota_\xi \Omega = 0 \, , \\[2mm]
									\dd \sigma = 2 \omega \, ,		&	\phantom{\dd}	&\dd \Omega = (n+1) i \sigma \wedge \Omega \, .
								\end{array}
							\end{equation}
						%
					Note that given a Sasaki-Einstein manifold, its metric can always be re-written as,
						%
							\begin{equation}
								\dd s^2 = \sigma \otimes \sigma + \dd s^2_{KE} \, ,
							\end{equation}
						%
					where $\dd s^2_{KE}$ is the metric on a generic K\"ahler-Einstein base.
					From this, we can say that the Reeb vector defines a \emph{foliation}, \emph{i.e.} it splits the tangent bundle into integral sub-bundles, whose set of leaves is a K\"ahler-Einstein space.
					Such a foliation is called (not surprisingly) \emph{Reeb foliation}.
					
					\paragraph{Tri-Sasakian Manifolds} 
					There is a sub-class of the Sasaki-Einstein manifolds, the so-called \emph{Tri-Sasakian manifolds} which is interesting not only because it has applications in flux compactifications~\cite{DavideTriSas}, but also simply to show how reduced holonomy gives rise to structures with different properties~\cite{TriSasakiReview}.
					
					In order to define this class of manifolds, we have to give the definition of \emph{Hyperk\"ahler manifold}.
					As one can see in~\cref{tabhol}, one possible definition can be the one through holonomy groups.
					Indeed, an hyperk\"ahler manifold is a Riemannian manifold $(M,g)$ of dimension $4k$ and holonomy group $\mathrm{Hol}(g)$ that is contained in the symplectic group $\Sp(k)$.
					Note that all the hyperk\"ahler manifolds are also Calabi-Yau (the metric $g$ is Ricci-flat), since $\Sp(k) \subset \SU(2k)$.
					
					Also in this case we can study the structures defined on this kind of manifolds.
					An hyperk\"ahler manifold has a set of three complex structures $\{I, J, K\}$ with respect to which the metric is K\"ahler.
					The three complex structures respect the Hamilton algebra of quaternions~\cite{EncyclMath},
						%
							\begin{equation}
								I^2 = J^2 = K^2 = - \id \, ,
							\end{equation}
						%
					and they also have the property that any linear combination with real coefficients $\alpha I + \beta J + \gamma K$, and $\alpha^2 + \beta^2 + \gamma^2 = 1$ is a complex structure on $M$.
					Because of these one can say that the tangent space at any point is a quaternionic vector space.
					
					A \emph{tri-Sasakian manifold} is a Sasaki-Einstein manifold whose cone is hyperk\"ahler.
					This definition constrains the dimension of a tri-Sasakian manifold to be $4n+3$, and $n \geq 1$.
					As usual, since it is more useful for our purposes we give an equivalent characterisation in terms of tensors defining structures.
					
					A tri-Sasakian manifold has three mutual orthogonal Killing vectors $\xi_i$, such that each of them is a Reeb vector, and all together they generate an $\SU(2)$ algebra,
						%
							\begin{equation}
								\left[\xi_i , \xi_j \right] = 2 \epsilon_{ij}^{\phantom{ij}k} \xi_k \, .
							\end{equation}
						%
					They also have their associated dual contact forms, \emph{i.e.} $\sigma^i$ such that $\sigma^i (\xi_j) = \delta^i_j$.
					Each $\sigma^i$ satisfies the differential relation,
						%
							\begin{equation}
								\dd \sigma^i = 2 J^i - \epsilon_{\phantom{i}jk}^i \sigma^j \wedge \sigma^k \, ,
							\end{equation}
						%
					where $\iota_{\xi_i}J^{j} = 0$.
					Takind the exterior derivative of the relation above one gets
						%
							\begin{equation}
								\dd J^i = 2 \epsilon^{i}_{\phantom{i}jk} J^j \wedge J^k \, .
							\end{equation}
						%
					
					As one may expect, the three Reeb vectors define what is known under the name of \emph{tri-Sasakian foliation}, whose space of leaves is a quaternionic K\"ahler space (whose holonomy group is contained in $\Sp(n)\Sp(1)$) $B_{QK}$, and the metric on the tri-Sasaki can be written as,
						%
							\begin{equation}
								\dd s^2 = \dd s^2_{B_{QK}} + \sigma^i \otimes \sigma ^i \, .
							\end{equation}
						%
					To conclude this discussion, we want to make the following remark.
					For any linear combination $\alpha^i \xi_i$ with $\alpha^i \alpha^i =1$, we can define a Sasaki-Einstein through,
						%
							\begin{align*}
								\sigma &= \alpha_i \sigma^i \, , \\
								\omega &= \alpha_i \left(J^i - \frac{1}{2} \epsilon^i_{\phantom{i}jk} \sigma^j \wedge \sigma^k \right) \, , \\
								\Omega &=  \left(\beta_j \sigma^j - i \gamma_j \sigma^j  \right) \wedge \left(\beta_k J^k - i \gamma_k J^k  \right)\, ,
							\end{align*}
						%
					where $\beta_i$ and $\gamma_i$ are sets of coefficients such that $\beta^i \xi_i$ and $\gamma^i \xi_i$ are mutually orthogonal.
					The coefficients (up to the orthogonality condition) can be chosen arbitrarily, since the various choices gives the same Sasaki-Einstein structures up to the phase of $\Omega$.
					This freedom in the choice of the phase reflects in the fact that studying a compactification on a Sasaki-Einstein structure, the authors of~\cite{Gauntlett:2009zw} found an extra $\U(1)$ symmetry.
